> Dear friend,
> I think of you so wholly that I cannot resist to write again, to ask if you are safe?
> Danger is not at first, for then we are unconscious, but in the after - slower - Days -
> Do not try to be saved - but let Redemption find you - as it certainly will - Love is it's own rescue, for we-at our supremest, are but it's trembling Emblems -

> Your scholar -

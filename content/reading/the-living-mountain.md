This is an absolutely beautiful reflection on the relationship between person and landscape. 
Nan Shepherd writes about her experience exploring the Cairngorm mountains in the Scottish highlands.
She writes with a sincere sense of wonder and humility in light of the mystery and power of the mountains.
I listened and re-listened to this book in audio format on walks through the woods on the weekends and was
enthralled with the text from beginning to end.

I decided to pick this up while thinking about works of literature
about the prairie and life in the American midwest during the late 19th
century. Willa Cather's descriptions of the landscape - its vastness,
mystery, and raw beauty - and its profound affect on Jim, an orphan from
Virginia, and Antonia, a Bohemian immigrant, are captivating.
The real strength of this novel lies in its subtle portrayal of meaningful
human relationships. We witness, from Jim's perspective, the formation of a
deep bond with his childhood friend Antonia, and its lasting effect on the memory
of both of the characters. 

Early parts of the book (and in particular, the scene recounting the deadly sleigh 
ride retold by the Russian immigrant Pavel on his deathbed, wherein he and Peter 
throw a newlywed couple off of the sleigh he is driving to a pack of wolves stalking 
the party in order to save themselves) have a fairytale-esque quality.

The last third of the novel has left a strong impression on me; I would
recommend this novel. Though there is no way to convey the emotional power of
language without greater context, but here are a few excerpts that stuck with me:',

> This was the road over which Antonia and I came on that night when we got
off the train at Black Hawk and were bedded down in the straw, wondering children,
being taken we knew not whither. I had only to close my eyes to hear the rumbling
of the wagons in the dark, and to be again overcome by that obliterating strangeness.
The feelings of that night were so near that I could reach out and touch them with
my hand. I had the sense of coming home to myself, and of having found out what a
little circle man's experience is. For Antonia and for me, this had been the road of
Destiny; had taken us to those early accidents of fortune which predetermined for
us all that we can ever be. Now I understood that the same road was to bring us
together again. Whatever we had missed, we possessed together the precious, the
incommunicable past.'

> In the course of twenty crowded years one parts with many illusions.
I did not wish to lose the early ones. Some memories are realities, and are
better than anything that can ever happen to one again. She asked me whether I
had learned to like big cities. 'I'd always be miserable in a city. I'd die of
lonesomeness. I like to be where I know every stack and tree, and where all the
ground is friendly. I want to live and die here. Father Kelly says everybody's put into
this world for something, and I know what I've got to do. I'm going to see that my
little girl has a better chance than ever I had. I'm going to take care of that girl, Jim.'
I told her I knew she would. 'Do you know, Antonia, since I've been away, I think of
you more often than of anyone else in this part of the world. I'd have liked to have
you for a sweetheart, or a wife, or my mother or my sister—anything that a woman can be
to a man. The idea of you is a part of my mind; you influence my likes and dislikes, all
my tastes, hundreds of times when I don't realize it. You really are a part of me.' She
turned her bright, believing eyes to me, and the tears came up in them slowly, 'How can
it be like that, when you know so many people, and when I've disappointed you so? Ain't
it wonderful, Jim, how much people can mean to each other? I'm so glad we had each other
when we were little. I can't wait till my little girl's old enough to tell her about all
the things we used to do. You'll always remember me when you think about old times, won't
you? And I guess everybody thinks about old times, even the happiest people.' As we walked
homeward across the fields, the sun dropped and lay like a great golden globe in the low
west. While it hung there, the moon rose in the east, as big as a cart-wheel, pale silver
and streaked with rose colour, thin as a bubble or a ghost-moon. For five, perhaps ten
minutes, the two luminaries confronted each other across the level land, resting on
opposite edges of the world. In that singular light every little tree and shock of wheat,
every sunflower stalk and clump of snow-on-the-mountain, drew itself up high and pointed;
the very clods and furrows in the fields seemed to stand up sharply. I felt the old pull
of the earth, the solemn magic that comes out of those fields at nightfall. I wished I
could be a little boy again, and that my way could end there. We reached the edge of the
field, where our ways parted. I took her hands and held them against my breast, feeling
once more how strong and warm and good they were, those brown hands, and remembering how many
kind things they had done for me. I held them now a long while, over my heart. About us it
was growing darker and darker, and I had to look hard to see her face, which I meant always
to carry with me; the closest, realest face, under all the shadows of women's faces, at the
very bottom of my memory. 'I'll come back,' I said earnestly, through the soft, intrusive
darkness. 'Perhaps you will'— I felt rather than saw her smile. 'But even if you don't,
you're here, like my father. So I won't be lonesome.' As I went back alone over that
familiar road, I could almost believe that a boy and girl ran along beside me, as our
shadows used to do, laughing and whispering to each other in the grass.'

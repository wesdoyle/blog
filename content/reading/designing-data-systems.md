An engaging high-level tour of typical problems, solutions, and the associated trade-offs that occur any system that writes, reads, updates, and deletes data. 
Reads a bit like an almanac of software patterns and specific implementations used in practice, which I found very enjoyable. Covers a wide range of topics, 
including storage and retrieval, OLTP and OLAP, replication and partitioning, distributed transactions, 2PC, consistency and consensus, and batch and stream processing. 
Required reading for an introduction to understanding common database patterns and distributed systems.

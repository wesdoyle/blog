I heard about this book in late 2016 while watching a YouTube video of
Daniel Dennett talking about consciousness. I remembered the title while
laying in bed one evening and found the book on Kindle. I purchased a copy
and spent the next few hours reading it. The author and the text are wildly
interesting. Marais was a South African who lived from 1871 to 1936, working
as a lawyer, journalist, poet, naturalist, and newspaper owner. According to his
Wikipedia biography, he became addicted to opiates while young, and his wife died
as a result of giving birth to their only son. He also had to deal with the
plagiarism of his work conducted for this book (by a Nobel Prize winner, no less!).
Tragically, he took his own life in 1936. He is recognized as the first person to
conduct scientific research of animal behavior in the wild. In this book, Marais
examines the behavior of termites and the termite colony in detail. I was struck
by the extent of his research. He describes at great length the structure and
behavior of the colony - the roles of each type of termite, the sort of hierarchical
class structure. Most notably, he may be the first to posit the idea that the
termite colony behaves essentially as a complex organism itself - a sort of
emergent phenomenon comprised of many smaller, less complex parts, none of
which are likely to be aware of the whole. This was a fascinating book and
worth picking up.

After listening intently to Edwin Barnhart's lecture series on the Ancient Civilizations
of North America, I picked up this series, which covers a range of topics on ancient
Mesoamerica, focusing primarily on the Olmec, Aztec and Mayan civiliations.  It was
particularly interesting to learn about the Dresden Codex, one of the four remaining
Mayan books, which includes, among many interesting astronomical ideas,
the Venus pages, which enumerates dates grouped by the 584-day synodic period of Venus.

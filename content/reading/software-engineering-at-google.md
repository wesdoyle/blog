Despite the niche-sounding title, this book is a fantastic resource for understanding
engineering practices that enable engineers to create and maintain high quality software.

I really enjoyed the detailed exploration of cultural topics like knowledge sharing and leadership, 
as well as technical considerations of various types of testing, static code analysis, and dependency management. 
Highly recommended book for mid- to senior-level software engineers and managers looking to gain a well-rounded understanding of 
the scope and depth of the practices and tradeoffs in modern, quality-focused software engineering.

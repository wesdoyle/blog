I enjoy listening to both Jason Fried and DHH talk about business
and software development. I appreciate their common-sense, pragmatic
approach to running a business. Several key points that stuck with me
from this book include the idea to "emulate chefs" by teaching what
you know to build a trusting audience, and to always try to "do a job"
before hiring for the same position, so that you have some basis of
understanding the particular challenges involved. I also appreciate
their emphasis on limiting the number of things you try to achieve in
order to do them well. This book seemed fairly congruent with Ari Weinzweg's
The Power of Belief in Business - a book I enjoyed from his "Lapsed
Anarchist's Guide" series, which has a similar unpretentious (yet strongly
opinionated) vibe.

> If you are trying to decide among a few people to fill a position,
hire the best writer. It doesn’t matter if that person is a marketer,
salesperson, designer, programmer, or whatever; their writing skills will
pay off. That’s because being a good writer is about more than writing.
Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking. Great writers know how to
communicate. They make things easy to understand. They can put themselves
in someone else’s shoes. They know what to omit. And those are qualities
you want in any candidate.

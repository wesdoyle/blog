This is an autobiographical account of Frankl's experience as
a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps. It is a brief, powerful account
of the unimaginable suffering of life in WWII concentration camps and what
it revealed to the author about human nature. Frankl seeks to understand
human experience through the lens of his concept of "Logotherapy," which is
based on the premise that the ultimate motivation of any individual is to
find a meaning in life. He asserts that life has meaning even in the most
unimaginable states of suffering, and that man has the freedom to find it in
his actions, life experiences, and his own dispositions, even when the state
of the world is not within his control. This book caused me to reflect on
writings of the Stoic tradition - particularly Epictetus (the Enchridion).',

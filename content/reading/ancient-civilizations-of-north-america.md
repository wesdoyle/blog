I listened to this over the course of several weeks in January and February
and was completely fascinated by the lectures. I picked it up while browsing
Audible and realizing I had no conception of the history or cultures of ancient
North America. While I was familiar with Cahokia, I was intrigued to learn about
Poverty Point, North America's first known city, and Poverty Point culture. It
was also particularly interesting to learn about the Clovis and Folsom cultures
and the ancient fauna of North America. The lectures were accompanied by a 200+
page PDF with maps and photographs of many historic sites and artifacts.

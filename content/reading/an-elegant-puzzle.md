It's interesting to learn from Larson's experience as an engineer and
manager. In this book, he covers a great deal about managing software,
including sizing engineering teams, managing technical debt, fostering
communities of learning, and systems thinking. I'd recommend this book
to any software engineer or manager.'

> Finally, the one thing that I’ve found at companies with very few
interruptions and have observed almost nowhere else: really great,
consistently available documentation. It’s probably even harder to
bootstrap documentation into a non-documenting company than it is to
bootstrap unit tests into a non-testing company, but the best solution
to frequent interruptions I’ve seen is a culture of documentation,
documentation reading, and a documentation search that actually works.

> Most system-implemented systems are designed to support one to two orders
magnitude of growth from the current load. Even systems designed for more growth
tend to run into limitations within one to two orders of magnitude. If your
traffic doubles every six months, then your load increases an order of magnitude
every 18 months. (And sometimes new features or products cause load to increase
much more quickly.) The cardinality of supported systems increases over time as
you add teams, and as "trivial" systems go from unsupported afterthoughts to focal
points for entire teams as the systems reach scaling plateaus (things like Apache
Kafka, mail delivery, Redis, etc.).

> Instead of asking the candidate to explain some architecture on the spur
of the moment, give them a warning before the interview that you'll ask them to
talk about a given topic for 30 minutes, which is a closer approximation of
what they'd be doing on the job. Debugging or extending an existing codebase
on a laptop (ideally on their laptop). This is much more akin to the
day-to-day work of development than writing an algorithm on the board. A great
problem can involve algorithmic components without coming across as a pointless
algorithmic question. (One company I spoke with had me implement a full-stack
auto-suggest feature for a search inbox, which required implementing a prefix tree,
but the interviewer avoided framing it as yet another algo question.)

> Have you ever worked at a company where the same two people always got
the most important projects? Me too. It's frustrating to watch these opportunities
to learn from the sidelines, and reliance on a small group can easily limit a
company's throughput as it grows. This is so important that I’ve come to believe
that having a wide cohort of coworkers who lead critical projects is one of the
most important signifiers of good organizational health.

Fairly enjoyable read. Listened to the novel as an audiobook while pulling weeds. I picked this up more or less by chance, 
though it was an interesting choice in the sense that it reflected an intersection of the ideas Nietzche and Jung 
during a period when I am deeply fascinated by Jung and had just listened to a Great Courses series on Nietzche. 
Generally fascinating, though not entirely resonant with my developing perspective on the topic of self-will 
that has occupied a lot of space in my thoughts recently. Considering less the specific ideas explored in the book, 
I've thought a bit about the phenomenon of the emergence of characters like Max Demian in reality - people who capture 
some aspect of the psyche and who serve as formative inspiration, challengers, or guides.

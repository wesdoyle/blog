The 1990 audio recording narrated by Rob Inglis is excellent. Inglis's
rendition of the songs and poems in the book and voices of the characters
brought the recording to life. I enjoyed listening to Tolkien's foreword about
the origin of the Lord of the Rings. In the foreword, he mentions his disdain
for allegory:

> The prime motive was the desire of a tale-teller to try his hand at a
really long story that would hold the attention of readers, amuse them,
delight them, and at times maybe excite them or deeply move them. ... I
cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done
so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer
history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and
experience of readers. I think that many confuse 'applicability' with
'allegory'; but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the
other in the purposed domination of the author.'

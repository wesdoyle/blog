I'm currently reading this book based on a recommendation.
I really enjoy Schneier's writing style; he covers complex material in
the most easy-to-follow manner. He explains each of the protocols detailed
in the book at as numbered-list sets of actions between actors, and writes
just enough about each topic for the reader to develop a strong high-level
understanding. The book covers a range of topics, including many common cryptographic
protocols, algorithms, and real world implementations. The breadth and specificity
of topics covered is quite wide and varied - everything from common concepts like man
in the middle, various one-way hashing algorithms, and public key algorithms, to
more esoteric concepts, like zero-knowledge proofs, Ohta-Okamoto identification,
or even how Kereberos works - is covered in the text.

> There are two kinds of cryptography in this world: cryptography that
will stop your kid sister from reading your files, and cryptography that
will stop major governments from reading your files. This book is about
the latter.

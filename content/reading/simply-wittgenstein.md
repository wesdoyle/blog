This was a fantastic introduction to the famous 20th century philosopher.
I became interested in Wittgenstein after spending some time reading about
Logical Positivism in 2014. I\'d since picked up a copy of this book, as well
as the biographies "Wittgenstein" by A.C. Grayling and "Wittgenstein - The Duty
of Genius" by Ray Monk. I continue to be intrigued by the picture theory of
language as well as the concept of language-game (Sprachspiel), the rule-following
paradox, and private language arguments. The philosophies of language and logic continue
to be a source of great interest, and I am interested in how they contribute to
problem-solving and reasoning about concepts natural language processing and
artificial intelligence.

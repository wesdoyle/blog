Building software to solve your own business problems is one of the best ways to learn about building software for external customers.

There are so many things to learn writing code during all phases of the software development lifecycle.  However, writing code for yourself (or your team) on internal projects provides the only true opportunity to practice operating from a customer's perspective.

Building software for yourself presents an opportunity to do the following:

## 1. It's an opportunity to view outcomes as a customer

## 2. It's a chance to build a new thing

In my experience working with teams of software engineers, I've found very few people have experience building new things.  

## 3. It allows you to take risks

## 4. It allows you to experiment

## 5. It allows you to practice technical decision making

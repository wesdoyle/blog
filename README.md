# Blog 

This is my personal blog.  I keep my (mostly non-software-related) reading notes here, and occassionally write technical blog posts.

## Notes

If you're interested, I've built this iteration of the blog using Gridsome, which is a JAMstack Vue.js static site generator.  My blog posts and reading notes are written in markdown.  The app is deployed using Netlify.
